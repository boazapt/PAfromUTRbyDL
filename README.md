# Predicting PA from UTR genome data using deep learning

## Introduction

This project is a deep leanrning prediction model for Protein Abundance levels based on the 50nt upstream of the start codon (UTR5)

## Files:
1. PAfromUTRbyDL.ipynb - jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the networks models
2. XXX - script for extracting raw data from genum files (downloaded from NCBI) and upload to DB
3. XXX - script for calculating the CAI values for each bacteria
4. XXX - script for building data file for the networks
5. XXX - file with 75K labeled data for the fully connected and CNN models
6. XXX - file with 75K labeled data for the random forest model
